# SQL Inventory Management and Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes product inventory, sales, and warehouse performance using SQL. The goal is to provide actionable insights for optimizing inventory, improving sales, and assessing warehouse efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Inventory Analysis**: Analyzes how many products are stored in each warehouse and which warehouses have the highest stock.
- **Sales Performance**: Tracks the most frequently sold products, evaluates product profitability, and identifies top customers.
- **Warehouse and Delivery**: Analyzes warehouse performance and delivery times.
- **Product Categorization**: Categorizes products based on sales velocity (fast, moderate, slow moving).
- **Scenario Modeling**: Models the impact of a 5% inventory reduction on product lines.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data from product, sales, and warehouse tables.
2. **Analysis**: Ran queries to evaluate stock levels, sales performance, and warehouse efficiency.
3. **Scenario Modeling**: Applied a 5% reduction in inventory across product categories and analyzed the impact.
4. **Optimization Insights**: Provided insights on improving inventory management and sales strategies.
